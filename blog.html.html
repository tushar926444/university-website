        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Program for 2021</h2>
         <p>This concept is pretty self-explanatory. The power behind asking your alumni to write the story is that it’s one thing to be happy with your college choice while you’re still a college student, but remaining satisfied with your choice of college years later says something entirely different.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This concept is especially relevant for graduate and professional schools out there. Your prospective students are coming to you for one reason, and that’s to better their career. Make sure you’re demonstrating that others sought the same thing and succeeded using their college network.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Faculty are too often stereotyped as research addicts who only teach as a requirement to researching. For many faculty, that’s just not the case. Give them a platform to talk about what they love about teaching, and then share that content with any prospective or admitted students in your database that are considering studying in that school or major.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I worked in admissions, my institution had an additional, optional, writing essay that applicants could submit. If your school or college has something similar, make sure you are sharing what that unique aspect is and what students, if applicable, should include it.</p>
